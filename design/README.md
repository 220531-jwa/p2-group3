# Doggy Day Care

## Background

The owner of a doggy day care wants a website built that clients can sign up and register a dog to go the to Day-Care with. The website should also be able to also provide additional grooming services along side the normal day-care activities.

## Requirements

A dog owner can register and login into an account and register their dogs information. Only the dog owner is able to see their own and their dogs information.

The shop owner needs to be able to see the dogs that were appointed for a specified day, as well as which dogs needs groomed. However the dog owner can only deal with up to 10 dogs a day. And is only open Monday-Friday 8AM - 4PM.

After a dog owner registers their dog for a day to drop-off, they will physically take their dog to the doggy-care, and will check-in their dog with the owner.

After the time is up and the dog-owner picks up their dog the owner checks the dog out.
