# Doggy Daycare System (DDS)

## Project Description

The Doggy Daycare System (DDS) manages the process of customers booking and tracking reservations and services for their furry friends at the Doggy Daycare. Once a customer has created their account they have the ability to login, update their personal information, register their dog(s), update their dog information, book a new reservation and services for a dog, view all past/current reservations and services, as well as cancel a reservation if needed.
